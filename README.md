# Espresso-Bar-Slot-Machine
## The slot machine has three reels:

1. The first reel has coffee grounds, loose tea, and espresso beans.
2. The second reel has a coffee filter, a tea strainer, and an espresso tamper.
3. The third reel has a coffee maker, a teapot, and an espresso machine.

When the user clicks the blue button 'Spin the Wheels!', the slot machine goes into action. 

Each reel spins and randomly stops on one of the three options. 

If the user is lucky, the three reels will line up and she will be rewarded with a tasty hot beverage. 

For example, if the reels show coffee maker, coffee filter, and coffee grounds, the user wins a cup of coffee.
